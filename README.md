# AniMangadle

A LoLdle inspired guessing game site for Anime and Manga enthusiasts. 
Check out the site here: [AniMangadle](https://demeil1.github.io/animangadle/)

# How Does it Work?

AniMangadle pulls the top 200 Anime and Manga from the [My Anime List](https://myanimelist.net/) website. When you open the app you are prompted with the medium you prefer (Anime or Manga?). Then, a random Anime or Manga is chosen for you to guess. Keep guessing using the information about the series as clues as to which direction you need to move in. Reset the winning Anime or Manga with the reset button if you feel it's too difficult and a new selection will be chosen.

# Guessing Aids:
* <span style="color:red">Green</span>: you got the section correctly!
* <span style="color:red">Orange</span>: some parts of the section are correct; however, some pieces are incorrect or missing.
* <span style="color:red">Red</span>: nothing in the section is correct, try again.
* &#8593;: the series was created later than your guess.
* &#8595;: the series was created earlier than your guess
